## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher installed.
- Apache Maven or Gradle installed (for building the project).
- MySQL server installed and running.
- A REST client (e.g., Postman or cURL) for testing the API endpoints.
